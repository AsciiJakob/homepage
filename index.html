					<h2>Who are you?</h2>
					<p>
						I‚Äôm Jakob, an 18-year-old jack-of-all-trades programmer from Sweden who loves building and breaking software and learning about interesting things. The only pseudonym I go by is ‚ÄúAsciiJakob‚Äù. I‚Äôve been programming since I was 12-13 years old, and I've been fascinated by computers for as long as I can remember.

				<h2>Can I contact you?</h2>
					<p>
						You can do anything you set your mind to if you just believe in yourself and really commit to it! Contact information is found further down, in the footer.

					<h2>What is your favourite thing about programming?</h2>
					<p>
						Programming can be used as a tool to create really cool and awesome stuff, but it‚Äôs also an intrinsically fun process. To solve problem after problem, using skills and knowledge you‚Äôve collected from all kinds of contexts over years.
					</p>
					<p>
						When programming, you <span class="hl">require</span> a willingness to learn and learn and learn, and to have patience with whatever it is you are dealing with. This can make it frustrating, but also really rewarding if you're able to stick with it.
					</p>
					<p>
						As humans, we love gradually difficult tasks and getting into the flow of some stimulating activity, that is something that programming really appeals to.
					</p>
					<p>
						It‚Äôs always a joy to explore new areas and concepts, and to learn about the various potentially interesting problems that people have had to solve there.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="aboutMeInfo">
					<h2>What skills do you have?</h2>
					<p>
						When it comes to programming languages, I like to think that I am pretty proficient at using <span class="hl">Javascript</span>. I am also familiar with the syntax of <span class="hl">Lua</span>, <span class="hl">GLSL</span>, <span class="hl">HLSL</span>, <span class="hl">AT&T ASM</span>, <span class="hl">C</span> and <span class="hl">C#</span>. Though it‚Äôs difficult to rank my proficiency in these: some I am rather comfortable with, others I don't use much at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am also somewhat decent at Docker and Linux, though just to the extent of which I have been using them.

							Surprisingly few, actually. I‚Äôve mostly been focusing on smaller projects,<br>
