					<h2>What is your favourite thing about programming?</h2>
					<p>
					Programming can be a tool to create really cool and awesome stuff, but it’s also a fun process in and of it self. To solve problem after problem, using skills and knowledge you’ve collected from all kinds of contexts over years.<br>
					Programming <span class="hl">requires</span> a willingness to learn and learn and learn and to have patience with whatever it is you are dealing with, which can make it frustrating but also really rewarding if you're able to stick with it.<br>
					As humans we love gradually difficult tasks and getting into the flow of some stimulating activity, and programming really appeals to that.
					</p>
					<p>
						It’s always a joy to explore new areas of computing or technology and learn about the various potentially interesting problems that people have had to solve there.<br>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="aboutMeInfo">
					<h2>What skills do you have?</h2>
					<p>
						When it comes to programming languages I’m most used to <span class="hl">Javascript</span>, but I also know how to use <span class="hl">Lua</span>, <span class="hl">GLSL</span>, <span class="hl">HLSL</span>, <span class="hl">C#</span>, and <span class="hl">Python</span><br>
						I’m not saying I’m a god or a wizard in all of these, it’s difficult to rank proficiency, these are just languages that I feel somewhat comfortable in.<br>
						Outside the topic of languages I am somewhat decent at Docker and Linux, though just to the level of what I am using them at.<br>
